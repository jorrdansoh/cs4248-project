CS4248 Project
Overview
This GitHub repository is managed by Jordan Soh Jing Ren and Tan How Suen, focused on machine learning with code predominantly in Jupyter Notebook and Python. The project appears to involve experimentation with various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Prompt Engineering, and Transformers.

Features
Logistic Regression: Basic machine learning model for binary classification tasks.
MLP: A type of neural network used for a range of prediction tasks.
Prompt Engineering: Techniques for optimizing inputs to improve model performance.
Transformer: Advanced model architecture predominantly used in NLP.

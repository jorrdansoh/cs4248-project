## Overview
This repository contains the necessary files to recreate our group project work for NUS CS4248 Natural Language Processing AY23/24 Sem 2.
The project focuses on document classification in the domain of news articles, seeking to appropriately label reliability in a 4-way classification model of Reliable, Satire, Hoax, or Propaganda.
Models/Techniques, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, MLP, Transformer, and Prompt Engineering, as well as a comprehensive set of preprocessing and feature engineering methods were explored. 

## Content 
- **Logistic Regression**: code for Logistic Regression
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: code for MLP
- **Prompt Engineering**: code for Prompt Engineering 
- **Transformer**: code for Transformer

## Dataset 
The Labeled Unreliable News Dataset curated by [Rashkin et al.,
2017](https://aclanthology.org/D17-1317.pdf) and used for the study can be found [here](https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CompareNet_FakeNewsDetection/releases/tag/dataset).
